# ImageRotation using OpenCV in C++:
 Welcome, this project is to rotate an image to a given angle by the user using **openCV** and c++. We use >wrafAffine funtion which is inbuilt in the **opencv library**. >wrafAffine takes 4 parametres- First is source image file i.e >src ,second is destination image file i.e >dst ,third parameter is mat object that is ouput after rotating >r with some point taking into reference and last is taking the size >boundW and >boundH. Here >boundW and >boundH are height and width of output image after scaling it to fit in the output window.

## Assumptions:
 - You have openCV version 4 in your machine.
 - You have C++ compiler.
